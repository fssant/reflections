1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug?
It was helpful because instead of search the whole file i just need to look on changed code, it provides me a fast way to find bugs.
2.How do easy access of a file history can make you more efficient in a long way?
Accessing a whole file history i have more control of my code changes.
3.In you opinion what are the pros and cons of manually choice when create a commit, as works on git between the auto save as on google docs?
pros:
you can make commits according logical content of file.
you can make commits when it is really necessary.


cons:
does not exist rules to create a commit, people can make mistakes and create big or small commits.
4.Why do you think some systems, like Git are able to save multiple files in a commit instead save file by file like Google docs?

Some files have logical conection, and changing one point make diference in other file, instead of change every single file, save multiples files in a commit are useful and save time. 

5.How do you use git log and git diff to view a historic of a file?

i use git log to find the id of a commit in the historic, and compare changes using git diff.

6.how can version control can give you more security to make changes that can bug some code?

version control permit access to all file history and so i can find bugs faster

7.Now you have configurated git, how do you want to use it?

I will implement my projects using git to help me to have more control and find bugs faster than before.
