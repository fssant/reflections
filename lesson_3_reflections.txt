1.When whould you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?
Its a good idea to maintain the project safe and to work with others contributors.
2.Why do you prefer manually pulls instead let git update remoto automatically? 
I can choose when i want to update my workspace files instead git decide it to me.
